# Master-Thesis-_TU-Chemnitz

Automated video-based real-time surveillance systems is an important application based field in computer vision. These systems are in huge demand, and when used in parallelism with computer vision algorithms, the use case expands in many dimensions.

Motivated by the requirements of AAL and surveillance systems, this master thesis deals with the capturing an entire room using a small number of omnidirectional cameras with a field of view larger than 180 degrees. The goal of this master thesis is to derive a constellation and configuration of the three omnidirectional cameras that enhance the 3-D reconstruction capability of the scenes observed. The input varies from various types of static scenes and the output is a point cloud reconstruction and the goodness measurement between the ground truth data and point clouds obtained.

The real 3D world scene (access given by the chair of DST, TU Chemnitz) is replicated virtually with the help of rendering software, Blender and the virtual scene is evaluated for two cases. One, being the baselines between the 3D cameras and second, being the angles between the cameras. The camera setup is that of an equilateral triangle, and it is tested for the above mentioned two cases to get the best configuration and constellation of the omnidirectional cameras for entire hemispherical view generation. The evaluation part deals with colouring a surface in the virtual scene and evaluating it with the point cloud generated using XPCV (developed by TU Chemnitz, uses all in-built functionalities of OpenCV).

This system aims at real-world scenarios and targets applications in surveillance, security, home automation, consumer electronics and assisted elderly care.
